For this iteration, I think we both did things well and had places where we can improve going forward. In terms of what we did well, we believe we did a good job of executing on the deliverables we set out to do. Aspects like our notification system, matching algorithm, our AI feature, and more were either fully finished or very close to being completed. However, I think that we could have done a better job of committing early and often. Towards the end of the iteration, we noticed we had some issues running the backend because significant changes were made. Going forward, we should make the effort to test incrementally over the course of the iteration so we can more easily find any bugs that can lead to not being able to run things. Additionally, I think we could have done a better job of creating more issues on the project board so it is more clear who is doing what. At times, people who were looking for new tasks to take on, would end up trying to work on tasks that were in the process of being completed by another team member. Thus, if we do a better job of creating issues (and explicitly assigning team members) and not just having the plain items on the board, we can better ensure that everyone is on the same page.
