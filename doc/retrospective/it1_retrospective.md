### Retrospective for Iteration 1
During iteration 1, our team performed well in several key areas, but also identified opportunities for improvement. Here’s a breakdown of our experiences:

## Achievements:
- Task Division: We divided the tasks effectively, allowing each team member to focus on their assigned work. Everyone delivered their deliverables on time, demonstrating good task ownership.
- Collaboration: We primarily collaborated over Slack, which proved efficient. Most issues were solved promptly, with the exception of a few that were addressed during classroom sessions.
- Learning and Development: Everyone was eager to learn new technologies, which made the learning-to-practice transition smooth. Our frontend pages became quite functional as a result.
- Git Branching Practice: We employed branching practices in Git, and the commits were generally well-managed.
## Challenges:
- Communication: As this was our first experience working as a team, we faced some difficulties explaining concepts to each other. Improving team communication will be a priority moving forward.
- Late Commits: A few commits were submitted late, though they didn’t significantly impact the timeline. However, we will work on addressing this issue in future iterations.
## Plan for the Next Iteration:
- User Story Assignment: To streamline task ownership, we will isolate user stories and assign them to individual team members. Each person will be responsible for fully completing their assigned user story.
- Improved Communication: While working on different features, we will make it a point to update the team on any changes that may affect the architecture, database, or codebase.
- Cloud Integration: We plan to move more of our application’s third-party dependencies (e.g., Kafka cluster) to the cloud to enhance scalability and reliability.

By addressing these areas, we aim to improve both our individual productivity and overall team efficiency in the next iteration.
