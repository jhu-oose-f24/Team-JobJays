### Retrospective 3

During this iteration our team delivered the rest of the required features for our web application such as the save job feature, apply job feature (job application), and a way for employer users to view the applied candidate.

We had good communication and colloboration this iteration. A lot of us worked together on different issues, provided help to others.

## For next Iteration

-There isn't a distinction yet between the users as we haven't continued inplementation for login authentication, but that is a feature we will finish for Iteration 4.

- Complete closing tasks early; since this iteration requires application deployment, we want to give ourselves as much time as possible to deploy the application and figure out issues that my arise.

- Check UI, make sure UI is consistent and presentable. See if clicking anything leads to an error and address (create issue)

- AI feature hopefully will be completed in this next iteration, but good progress was made regardless.
